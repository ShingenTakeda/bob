# Bob

C build and compiler manager(mainly zig and tcc)

## Another one??

Dude, like, configuring a c toolchain and enviroment sucks on windows,
either there is a lot of bloat(MSVC), or kinda of a
pain to setup(Mingw, Cygwin, clang) and both of those solutions are not portable.
So, to make things a little less painful,
bob in the future will be able to download compilers
and integrate to vscode.
